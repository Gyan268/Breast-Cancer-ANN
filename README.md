# Breast Cancer Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify breast cancer data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The dataset includes various continuous variables derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass.

## 📁 Files

- `Breast-Cancer-ANN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis and model building steps.
- `wisc_bc_ContinuousVar.csv`: Cleaned dataset containing continuous variables for classification.

## 🧠 Model

The project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

### Key Steps:
- Data Preprocessing (normalization, label encoding)
- ANN Model Creation
- Model Training and Evaluation (accuracy, loss)
- Visualization of results

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `ID`, `Diagnosis` (target), and 30 numerical features like:
  - Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow & Keras

## ✅ Results

The ANN model achieves high accuracy in classifying tumors, showing the effectiveness of deep learning in medical diagnostics.
